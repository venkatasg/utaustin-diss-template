Block quotes can be included as well, using the \texttt{quotation} package, as can be seen in the following quotation.
\begin{quotation}

Theorems can be added as Theorem \ref{thm:example}, along with definitions, lemmas, etc.
\begin{thm}
\label{thm:example}
Theorem here.

\section{Linguistic examples}

Linguistic examples with glosses can be included using commands from the \texttt{linguex} package. \emph{Bitstream Charter} (the default font) has support for most Latin characters --- \emph{Charis SIL} is also available to use as a font (since it has \href{https://software.sil.org/charis/charset/}{a larger glyph set}) using the \texttt{\textbackslash{}ipafont} command. \ref{ex:1} and \ref{ex:2} use the default font; \ref{ex:1} is typeset correctly, but \ref{ex:2} is not, as evidenced by the empty blocks (denoting characters/glyphs not available in the default font). \emph{Charis SIL} using the \texttt{\textbackslash{}ipafont} command remedies this, as seen in \ref{ex:3}:

\ex. \ag.\label{ex:1}það voru lesnar fjorar bækur.\\
          \textsc{expl} were read four.\textsc{pl.nom} book.\textsc{pl.nom}\\
          `Four books were read!'
     \bg.\label{ex:2}Ɂána-ǎnd’ǝh 	híd-ǎn 		g’ɔ́p-ɔ́h\\
         Ana-\textsc{ass.pl} \textsc{3pl-obj} scoop-\textsc{decl}\\
          `Ana and her children were serving them.'
     \bg.\label{ex:3}\ipafont{Ɂána-ǎnd’ǝh} \ipafont{híd-ǎn} \ipafont{g’ɔ́p-ɔ́h}\\
          Ana-\textsc{ass.pl} \textsc{3pl-obj} scoop-\textsc{decl}\\
          `Ana and her children were serving them.'

To write a multilingual document with scripts beyond Latin/Cyrillic, refer to \href{https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/how-to-write-multilingual-text-with-different-scripts-in-latex-on-overleaf/wfdxqhcyyjxz}{this document}, which describes how to use the \texttt{polyglossia} package to write in English, Arabic, Sanskrit, Hindi, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Greek and Thai, all in one document.
